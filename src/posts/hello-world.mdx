Take the trash out. In life you have to take the trash out, if you have trash in
your life, take it out, throw it away, get rid of it, major key. You do know,
you do know that they don’t want you to have lunch. I’m keeping it real with
you, so what you going do is have lunch.

## The Key

The key is to drink [coconut](https://www.google.com/search?q=coconut+juice),
fresh coconut, trust me[^1]. They don’t want us to win. The key to success is to
keep your head above the water, never give up. **Mogul talk**.

Surround yourself with:

1. angels
1. positive energy
1. beautiful people
1. beautiful souls

Find peace, life is like a water fall, you’ve gotta _flow_. The key to more
success is to have a lot of pillows. The key is to enjoy life, because they
don’t want you to enjoy life. I promise you, they don’t want you to jetski, they
don’t want you to smile.

## Wraith talk

The `key` is to have every key[^2], the key to open every door. How’s business?
Boomin. How’s business? Boomin. Congratulations, you played yourself. Put it
this way, it took me twenty five years to get these plants, twenty five years of
blood sweat and tears, and I’m never giving up, I’m just getting started. We the
best.

## Some unrelated `code`

```typescript
// Some code:
interface ITestInterface {
    a: number;
    b: string;
    c: boolean;
}

const test = (arg: string, { b: ITestInterface }) => {
    const test = 1;
    let variable = true;
    var constance = 'hello';
    console.log('Hullo');
};

const pluckDeep = (key) => (obj) =>
    key.split('.').reduce((accum, key) => accum[key], obj);

const compose = (...fns) => (res) =>
    fns.reduce((accum, next) => next(accum), res);

const unfold = (f, seed) => {
    const go = (f, seed, acc) => {
        const res = f(seed); // highlight-line
        return res ? go(f, res[1], acc.concat([res[0]])) : acc; // highlight-line
    };
    return go(f, seed, []);
};

const Component = () => <div component={true}>hello</div>;

const COLOR_ACCENT = '#BC4124';
const test = true;
const regex = /(.*)/;
```

Major key, don’t fall for the trap, stay focused. It’s the ones closest to you
that want to see you fail. In life there will be road blocks but we will over
come it. Another one. Celebrate success right, the only way, apple. The key is
to: enjoy life, because they don’t want you to enjoy life. I promise you, they
don’t want you to jetski, they don’t want you to smile. How’s business? Boomin.

## They don’t want us to eat breakfast

Egg whites, turkey sausage, wheat toast, water. Of course they don’t want us to
eat our breakfast, so we are going to enjoy our breakfast. The key is to drink
coconut, fresh coconut, trust me. You smart, you loyal, you a genius. Cloth
talk. You see that bamboo behind me though, you see that bamboo? Ain’t nothin’
like bamboo. Bless up. Lion! The key is to drink coconut, fresh coconut, trust

### Don't Panic!

A major key, never panic. _Don’t panic_, when it gets crazy and rough, don’t
panic, stay calm. In life there will be road blocks but we will over come it.
Give thanks to the most high. Wraith talk. Fan luv. We the best. To succeed you
must believe. When you believe, you will succeed. It’s important to use cocoa
butter. It’s the key to more success, why not live smooth? Why live rough? Watch
your back, but more importantly when you get out the shower, dry your back, it’s
a cold world out there. Put it this way, it took me twenty five years to get
these plants, twenty five years of blood sweat and tears, and I’m never giving
up, I’m just getting started.
